      Hibernate is a powerful, high performance object/relational persistence
and query service. Hibernate lets you develop persistent classes
following object-oriented idiom - including association, inheritance,
polymorphism, composition, and collections. Hibernate allows
you to express queries in its own portable SQL extension (HQL),
as well as in native SQL, or with an object-oriented Criteria
and Example API.
Unlike many other persistence solutions, Hibernate does not hide
the power of SQL from you and guarantees that your investment
in relational technology and knowledge is as valid as always.
The LGPL open source license allows the use of Hibernate and
NHibernate in open source and commercial projects.
