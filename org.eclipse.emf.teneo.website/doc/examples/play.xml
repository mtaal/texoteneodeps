        <line>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</line>
        <line>Draws on apace; four happy days bring in</line>
        <line>Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow</line>
        <line>This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,</line>

        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
        <line>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</line>
        <line>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</line>
        <line>Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</line>
        <line>This man hath my consent to marry her.</line>
        <line>Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,</line>
        <line>This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;</line>
        <line>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</line>
        <line>And interchanged love-tokens with my child:</line>
        <line>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,</line>
        <line>With feigning voice verses of feigning love,</line>
        <line>And stolen the impression of her fantasy</line>
        <line>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</line>
        <line>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers</line>
        <line>Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:</line>
        <line>With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,</line>
        <line>Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,</line>
        <line>To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,</line>
        <line>Be it so she; will not here before your grace</line>
        <line>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</line>
        <line>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,</line>
        <line>As she is mine, I may dispose of her:</line>
        <line>Which shall be either to this gentleman</line>
        <line>Or to her death, according to our law</line>
        <line>Immediately provided in that case.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:</line>
        <line>To you your father should be as a god;</line>
        <line>One that composed your beauties, yea, and one</line>
        <line>To whom you are but as a form in wax</line>
        <line>By him imprinted and within his power</line>
        <line>To leave the figure or disfigure it.</line>
        <line>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>So is Lysander.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>In himself he is;</line>
        <line>But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,</line>
        <line>The other must be held the worthier.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>I would my father look'd but with my eyes.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>I do entreat your grace to pardon me.</line>
        <line>I know not by what power I am made bold,</line>
        <line>Nor how it may concern my modesty,</line>
        <line>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</line>
        <line>But I beseech your grace that I may know</line>
        <line>The worst that may befall me in this case,</line>
        <line>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>Either to die the death or to abjure</line>
        <line>For ever the society of men.</line>
        <line>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;</line>
        <line>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</line>
        <line>Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,</line>
        <line>You can endure the livery of a nun,</line>
        <line>For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,</line>
        <line>To live a barren sister all your life,</line>
        <line>Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</line>
        <line>Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,</line>
        <line>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;</line>
        <line>But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,</line>
        <line>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn</line>
        <line>Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</line>
        <line>Ere I will my virgin patent up</line>
        <line>Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke</line>
        <line>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--</line>
        <line>The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,</line>
        <line>For everlasting bond of fellowship--</line>
        <line>Upon that day either prepare to die</line>
        <line>For disobedience to your father's will,</line>
        <line>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;</line>
        <line>Or on Diana's altar to protest</line>
        <line>For aye austerity and single life.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
        <line>Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield</line>
        <line>Thy crazed title to my certain right.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>You have her father's love, Demetrius;</line>
        <line>Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
        <line>Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,</line>
        <line>And what is mine my love shall render him.</line>
        <line>And she is mine, and all my right of her</line>
        <line>I do estate unto Demetrius.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,</line>
        <line>As well possess'd; my love is more than his;</line>
        <line>My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,</line>
        <line>If not with vantage, as Demetrius';</line>
        <line>And, which is more than all these boasts can be,</line>
        <line>I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:</line>
        <line>Why should not I then prosecute my right?</line>
        <line>Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,</line>
        <line>Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,</line>
        <line>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</line>
        <line>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</line>
        <line>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>I must confess that I have heard so much,</line>
        <line>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</line>
        <line>But, being over-full of self-affairs,</line>
        <line>My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;</line>
        <line>And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,</line>
        <line>I have some private schooling for you both.</line>
        <line>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</line>
        <line>To fit your fancies to your father's will;</line>
        <line>Or else the law of Athens yields you up--</line>
        <line>Which by no means we may extenuate--</line>
        <line>To death, or to a vow of single life.</line>
        <line>Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?</line>
        <line>Demetrius and Egeus, go along:</line>
        <line>I must employ you in some business</line>
        <line>Against our nuptial and confer with you</line>
        <line>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
        <line>With duty and desire we follow you.</line>
      </speech>
      <stageDirections>Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA</stageDirections>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?</line>
        <line>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>Belike for want of rain, which I could well</line>
        <line>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,</line>
        <line>Could ever hear by tale or history,</line>
        <line>The course of true love never did run smooth;</line>
        <line>But, either it was different in blood,--</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>O spite! too old to be engaged to young.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,</line>
        <line>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</line>
        <line>Making it momentany as a sound,</line>
        <line>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;</line>
        <line>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,</line>
        <line>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,</line>
        <line>And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'</line>
        <line>The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</line>
        <line>So quick bright things come to confusion.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,</line>
        <line>It stands as an edict in destiny:</line>
        <line>Then let us teach our trial patience,</line>
        <line>Because it is a customary cross,</line>
        <line>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</line>
        <line>Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.</line>
        <line>I have a widow aunt, a dowager</line>
        <line>Of great revenue, and she hath no child:</line>
        <line>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;</line>
        <line>And she respects me as her only son.</line>
        <line>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</line>
        <line>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</line>
        <line>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,</line>
        <line>Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;</line>
        <line>And in the wood, a league without the town,</line>
        <line>Where I did meet thee once with Helena,</line>
        <line>To do observance to a morn of May,</line>
        <line>There will I stay for thee.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>My good Lysander!</line>
        <line>I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,</line>
        <line>By his best arrow with the golden head,</line>
        <line>By the simplicity of Venus' doves,</line>
        <line>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</line>
        <line>And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,</line>
        <line>When the false Troyan under sail was seen,</line>
        <line>By all the vows that ever men have broke,</line>
        <line>In number more than ever women spoke,</line>
        <line>In that same place thou hast appointed me,</line>
        <line>To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</line>

      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>God speed fair Helena! whither away?</line>

        <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
        <line>Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.</line>
        <line>Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!</line>
        <line>Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air</line>
        <line>More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,</line>
        <line>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</line>
        <line>Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,</line>
        <line>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;</line>
        <line>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</line>
        <line>My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.</line>
        <line>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</line>
        <line>The rest I'd give to be to you translated.</line>
        <line>O, teach me how you look, and with what art</line>
        <line>You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
        <line>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</line>

      <speech>
        <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
        <line>O that my prayers could such affection move!</line>

        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</line>

        <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
        <line>None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!</line>

        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;</line>
        <line>Lysander and myself will fly this place.</line>
        <line>Before the time I did Lysander see,</line>
        <line>Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:</line>
        <line>O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,</line>
        <line>That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</line>
        <line>To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold</line>
        <line>Her silver visage in the watery glass,</line>
        <line>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,</line>
        <line>A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,</line>
        <line>Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>And in the wood, where often you and I</line>
        <line>Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,</line>
        <line>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</line>
        <line>There my Lysander and myself shall meet;</line>
        <line>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</line>
        <line>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</line>
        <line>Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;</line>
        <line>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</line>
        <line>Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight</line>
        <line>From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.</line>

        <line>How happy some o'er other some can be!</line>
        <line>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</line>
        <line>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</line>
        <line>He will not know what all but he do know:</line>
        <line>And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,</line>
        <line>So I, admiring of his qualities:</line>
        <line>Things base and vile, folding no quantity,</line>
        <line>Love can transpose to form and dignity:</line>
        <line>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</line>
        <line>And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:</line>
        <line>Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;</line>
        <line>Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:</line>
        <line>And therefore is Love said to be a child,</line>
        <line>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.</line>
        <line>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</line>
        <line>So the boy Love is perjured every where:</line>
        <line>For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,</line>
        <line>He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;</line>
        <line>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</line>
        <line>So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.</line>
        <line>I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:</line>
        <line>Then to the wood will he to-morrow night</line>
        <line>Pursue her; and for this intelligence</line>
        <line>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:</line>
        <line>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</line>
        <line>To have his sight thither and back again.</line>

        <line>Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more</line>
        <line>better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not</line>

        <speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
        <line>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to</line>

        <line>most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful</line>

      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>SNOUT</speaker>

        <speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
        <line>Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must</line>

        <line>must speak through, saying thus, or to the same</line>
        <line>defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish</line>
        <line>You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would</line>

        <line>for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it</line>
        <line>were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a</line>

        <line>another thing: we must have a wall in the great</line>

        <line>Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three</line>
        <line>To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.</line>
        <line>Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!</line>
        <line>Have you conspired, have you with these contrived</line>
        <line>To bait me with this foul derision?</line>
        <line>Is all the counsel that we two have shared,</line>
        <line>The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,</line>
        <line>When we have chid the hasty-footed time</line>
        <line>For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?</line>
        <line>All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?</line>
        <line>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</line>
        <line>Have with our needles created both one flower,</line>
        <line>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,</line>
        <line>Both warbling of one song, both in one key,</line>
        <line>As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,</line>
        <line>Had been incorporate. So we grow together,</line>
        <line>Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,</line>
        <line>But yet an union in partition;</line>
        <line>Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;</line>
        <line>So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;</line>
        <line>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</line>
        <line>Due but to one and crowned with one crest.</line>
        <line>And will you rent our ancient love asunder,</line>
        <line>To join with men in scorning your poor friend?</line>
        <line>It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:</line>
        <line>Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,</line>
        <line>Though I alone do feel the injury.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
        <line>I am amazed at your passionate words.</line>
        <line>I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.</line>

      <speech>
        <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
        <line>Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,</line>
        <line>To follow me and praise my eyes and face?</line>
        <line>And made your other love, Demetrius,</line>
        <line>Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,</line>
        <line>To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,</line>
        <line>Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this</line>
        <line>To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander</line>
        <line>Deny your love, so rich within his soul,</line>
        <line>And tender me, forsooth, affection,</line>
        <line>But by your setting on, by your consent?</line>
        <line>What thought I be not so in grace as you,</line>
        <line>So hung upon with love, so fortunate,</line>
        <line>But miserable most, to love unloved?</line>
        <line>This you should pity rather than despise.</line>

        <line>Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:</line>
        <line>This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.</line>
        <line>If you have any pity, grace, or manners,</line>
        <line>You would not make me such an argument.</line>

        <line>Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:</line>

        <line>I am as fair now as I was erewhile.</line>

      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>Ay, by my life;</line>
        <line>And never did desire to see thee more.</line>
        <line>Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;</line>
        <line>Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest</line>
        <line>That I do hate thee and love Helena.</line>

        <line>And stolen my love's heart from him?</line>

        <line>Fine, i'faith!</line>

        <line>Now I perceive that she hath made compare</line>
        <line>Between our statures; she hath urged her height;</line>
        <line>And with her personage, her tall personage,</line>
        <line>Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.</line>
        <line>And are you grown so high in his esteem;</line>
        <line>Because I am so dwarfish and so low?</line>
        <line>How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;</line>
        <line>How low am I? I am not yet so low</line>

        <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
        <line>I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,</line>

        <line>I have no gift at all in shrewishness;</line>
        <line>I am a right maid for my cowardice:</line>
        <line>Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,</line>
        <line>Because she is something lower than myself,</line>
        <line>That I can match her.</line>

        <line>Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;</line>
        <line>Save that, in love unto Demetrius,</line>
        <line>I told him of your stealth unto this wood.</line>
        <line>He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;</line>
        <line>But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me</line>
        <line>To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:</line>
        <line>And now, so you will let me quiet go,</line>
        <line>To Athens will I bear my folly back</line>

        <line>Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,</line>
        <line>Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes</line>
        <line>Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.</line>
        <line>When I had at my pleasure taunted her</line>
        <line>And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,</line>
        <line>I then did ask of her her changeling child;</line>
        <line>Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent</line>
        <line>To bear him to my bower in fairy land.</line>
        <line>And now I have the boy, I will undo</line>

      <stageDirections>Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine</stageDirections>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>I wonder if the lion be to speak.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
        <line>No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Wall</speaker>
        <line>In this same interlude it doth befall</line>
        <line>That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;</line>
        <line>And such a wall, as I would have you think,</line>
        <line>That had in it a crannied hole or chink,</line>
        <line>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,</line>
        <line>Did whisper often very secretly.</line>
        <line>This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show</line>
        <line>That I am that same wall; the truth is so:</line>
        <line>And this the cranny is, right and sinister,</line>
        <line>Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
        <line>It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard</line>
        <line>discourse, my lord.</line>
      </speech>
      <stageDirections>Enter Pyramus</stageDirections>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
        <line>O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!</line>
        <line>O night, which ever art when day is not!</line>
        <line>O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,</line>
        <line>I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!</line>
        <line>And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,</line>
        <line>That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!</line>
        <line>Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,</line>
        <line>Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!</line>
        <stageDirections>Wall holds up his fingers</stageDirections>
        <line>Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!</line>
        <line>But what see I? No Thisby do I see.</line>
        <line>O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!</line>
        <line>Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
        <line>No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'</line>
        <line>is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to</line>
        <line>spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will</line>
        <line>fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.</line>
      </speech>
      <stageDirections>Enter Thisbe</stageDirections>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
        <line>O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,</line>
        <line>For parting my fair Pyramus and me!</line>
        <line>My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,</line>
        <line>Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
        <line>I see a voice: now will I to the chink,</line>
        <line>To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
        <line>My love thou art, my love I think.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
        <line>Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;</line>
        <line>And, like Limander, am I trusty still.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
        <line>And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
        <line>Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
        <line>As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
        <line>O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
        <line>I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
        <line>Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
        <line>'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.</line>

      <stageDirections>Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe</stageDirections>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Wall</speaker>
        <line>Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;</line>
        <line>And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.</line>

      <stageDirections>Exit</stageDirections>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
        <line>No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear</line>
        <line>without warning.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
        <line>This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst</line>
        <line>are no worse, if imagination amend them.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
        <line>It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>If we imagine no worse of them than they of</line>
        <line>themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here</line>
        <line>come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.</line>
      </speech>
      <stageDirections>Enter Lion and Moonshine</stageDirections>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Lion</speaker>
        <line>You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear</line>
        <line>The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,</line>
        <line>May now perchance both quake and tremble here,</line>
        <line>When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.</line>
        <line>Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am</line>
        <line>A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;</line>
        <line>For, if I should as lion come in strife</line>
        <line>Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
        <line>The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>This lion is a very fox for his valour.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>True; and a goose for his discretion.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
        <line>Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his</line>
        <line>discretion; and the fox carries the goose.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;</line>
        <line>for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:</line>
        <line>leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Moonshine</speaker>
        <line>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
        <line>He should have worn the horns on his head.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>He is no crescent, and his horns are</line>
        <line>invisible within the circumference.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Moonshine</speaker>
        <line>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;</line>
        <line>Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man</line>
        <line>should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the</line>
        <line>man i' the moon?</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
        <line>He dares not come there for the candle; for, you</line>

      <speech>
        <speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>

      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
        <line>It appears, by his small light of discretion, that</line>

        <line>reason, we must stay the time.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
        <line>Proceed, Moon.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Moonshine</speaker>
        <line>All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the</line>
        <line>lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this</line>
        <line>thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.</line>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
        <line>Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all</line>
        <line>these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.</line>
      </speech>
      <stageDirections>Enter Thisbe</stageDirections>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
        <line>This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?</line>

        <line>Eyes, do you see?</line>

      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>

        <line>Now the wasted brands do glow,</line>
        <line>Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,</line>
        <line>Puts the wretch that lies in woe</line>
        <line>In remembrance of a shroud.</line>
        <line>Now it is the time of night</line>
        <line>That the graves all gaping wide,</line>
        <line>Every one lets forth his sprite,</line>
        <line>In the church-way paths to glide:</line>
        <line>And we fairies, that do run</line>
        <line>By the triple Hecate's team,</line>
        <line>From the presence of the sun,</line>
        <line>Following darkness like a dream,</line>
        <line>Now are frolic: not a mouse</line>
        <line>Shall disturb this hallow'd house:</line>
        <line>I am sent with broom before,</line>
        <line>To sweep the dust behind the door.</line>

      <stageDirections>Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train</stageDirections>
      <speech>
        <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
        <line>Through the house give gathering light,</line>
        <line>By the dead and drowsy fire:</line>
        <line>Every elf and fairy sprite</line>
        <line>Hop as light as bird from brier;</line>
        <line>And this ditty, after me,</line>
        <line>Sing, and dance it trippingly.</line>

      <speech>
        <speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
        <line>First, rehearse your song by rote</line>
        <line>To each word a warbling note:</line>
        <line>Hand in hand, with fairy grace,</line>
        <line>Will we sing, and bless this place.</line>

        <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
        <line>Now, until the break of day,</line>
        <line>Through this house each fairy stray.</line>
        <line>To the best bride-bed will we,</line>
        <line>Which by us shall blessed be;</line>
        <line>And the issue there create</line>
        <line>Ever shall be fortunate.</line>
        <line>So shall all the couples three</line>
        <line>Ever true in loving be;</line>
        <line>And the blots of Nature's hand</line>
        <line>Shall not in their issue stand;</line>
        <line>Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,</line>
        <line>Nor mark prodigious, such as are</line>
        <line>Despised in nativity,</line>
        <line>Shall upon their children be.</line>
        <line>With this field-dew consecrate,</line>
        <line>Every fairy take his gait;</line>
        <line>And each several chamber bless,</line>
        <line>Through this palace, with sweet peace;</line>
        <line>And the owner of it blest</line>
        <line>Ever shall in safety rest.</line>
        <line>Trip away; make no stay;</line>
        <line>Meet me all by break of day.</line>

        <speaker>PUCK</speaker>
        <line>If we shadows have offended,</line>
        <line>Think but this, and all is mended,</line>
        <line>That you have but slumber'd here</line>
        <line>While these visions did appear.</line>
        <line>And this weak and idle theme,</line>
        <line>No more yielding but a dream,</line>
        <line>Gentles, do not reprehend:</line>
        <line>if you pardon, we will mend:</line>
        <line>And, as I am an honest Puck,</line>
        <line>If we have unearned luck</line>
        <line>Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,</line>
        <line>We will make amends ere long;</line>
        <line>Else the Puck a liar call;</line>
        <line>So, good night unto you all.</line>
        <line>Give me your hands, if we be friends,</line>
        <line>And Robin shall restore amends.</line>
