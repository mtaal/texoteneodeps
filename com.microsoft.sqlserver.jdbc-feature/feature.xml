CHANGE LIST
-----------
Changes from 2.0 to 3.0:

327029 The &quot;Failed to load the sqljdbc_auth.dll&quot; exception now contains additional

329180 Application servers can now use the Wrapper interface to implement proxies of
       SQLServerDataSource instances and other classes implementing the Wrapper interface.

       the update count of an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE query, when lastUpdateCount=true

345336 An infinite loop in Statement.close() after its underlying connection is closed
       unexpectedly has been fixed.

351393 executeUpdate now returns the correct update count for a BULK INSERT query.

327052 ResultSet.getHoldability() now returns ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT when
       implicit cursor conversion produces a result set that is not backed by a
       server cursor.

374320 An infinite loop in ResultSet.close() has been fixed when the method encounters a
       lock timeout or other row error.

373923 The driver now uses the TLS protocol for its SSL communications, to comply with

411695 getSchemas should return schema information
